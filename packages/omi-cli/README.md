## CLI

```bash
$ npm i omi-cli -g               # install cli
$ omi init your_project_name     # init project, you can also exec 'omi init' in an empty folder
$ cd your_project_name           # please ignore this command if you executed 'omi init' in an empty folder
$ npm start                      # develop
$ npm run build                  # release
```

Cli's auto-created project scaffolding is based on a single-page create-react-app to be converted into a multi-page one, with configuration issues to see [create-react-app user guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)
